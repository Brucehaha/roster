# Back End Developer Exercise

The aim of this exercise is to simulate real working conditions to provide context for a code/design review session. The follow up review session will focus on your reasons for database/API design and pseudo-code/code implementation. As such it isn’t necessary to build a complete implementation, however having some runnable code is recommended (preferably in Python).

The suggested time to spend on this exercise is 2 hours.

# Instructions

For this challenge, we are looking for you to create the backend for a a simple rostering application for editing the shifts of employees. For example this application could be used for a small business that works 24/7 to manage the shifts of it's employees to make sure everyone gets adequate days off and doesn't get shifts which are directly back-to-back (eg working on a night shift followed by a morning shift the next day).

We're providing you with two mock data csv files which are typical of the type of data collected:

- Employees: The people who are being rostered
- Shifts: These are the bits of work assigned to employees.


The amount of time you spend on this exercise is up to you, and there are several activities you could consider depending on your strengths:

- Develop some questions (for the rosterer) that support further requirements that you might need in order to more fully specify such an application.
- Create a minimal database schema (or equivalently, ORM model definitions) for the application. You could also demonstrate the effectiveness of your schema by writing a routine to read the sample data from the database.
- Design a web API which could be used for communication between the web app's server and client.
- Describe and/or implement an algorithm which generates an allocation of staff to shifts.


If any of the requirements are unclear feel free to send through questions for clarification or make assumptions - we are not trying to test you on your knowledge of rostering.


What you deliver is up to you, some suggestions are:

- Git repo
- Python
- Django
- Postgresql
- Pseudo-code
- Diagrams (e.g. UML)
- Notes on assumptions or next steps you would take

Please create your solution in a fork off this repo. When you're ready to share your solution with us, email a link to your recruiter or Biarri contact.

On completion, if there are additional things you think you could have done better/did not have enough time to complete, feel free to compile a quick list and bring it to the technical interview to help remind yourself during the discussion.
